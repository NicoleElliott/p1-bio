			One common misconception about Tech Com is that it's a communications degree. It isn't.
			Tech Com is actually one of several English degrees offered here at EWU. We study writing,
			public relations, and graphic design. Find out more about the Tech Com program 
			<a href="http://www.ewu.edu/cale/programs/english/english-degrees/technical-communication.xml"> here.</a></p>
	
			I specialize in writing non-fiction content, particularly grant applications and instructional material.
			
			I also edit and create documents and graphics. I recently completed a team project redesigning a digital ebook,
			which can be viewed <a href="http://studentweb.ewu.edu/nelliott/group.html">here</a>. Some people refer to what 
			I do as "scientific writing."</p>   
					
			

            <h2 class="headers grid_12 alpha omega">Background Information</h2>

            <p class="grid_10 alpha">
                I grew up on the Olympic Peninsula. I still have friends and family there. I moved to Spokane with my husband and daughter in 1999. 
				I began my studies at Eastern Washington University to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Technical Communication in 2011, and I will graduate in 
				June 2014 with minors in Anthropology and Graphic Design. I also have experience writing and editing for an on-line entertainment magazine.
				</p>


            <h2 class="headers grid_12 alpha omega">Professional Objectives</h2>

            <p class="grid_10 alpha">
					My primary objective is to write content for a major publication, such as an academic journal. I am also interested in writing helpful user 
					instructions, winning grants for non-profit agencies, and helping people expand their educations. I prefer working independently, but I am 
					comfortable working on a group project as well. The best position will allow me to help the company increase readership and circulation and learn
					new writing skills.
				</p>
